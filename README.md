# 🧠 Simple Resume Analyzer

The Simple Resume Analyzer is a full-stack web application that analyzes uploaded resumes to extract key skills and recommends job roles based on a match percentage. Built with a React frontend and Flask backend, it uses NLP techniques to parse PDF resumes, compares extracted skills with a dataset of job requirements, and visualizes the top job matches via a dynamic bar chart. Job listings are fetched using the JSearch API. The backend is deployed on Render, while the frontend is hosted on Vercel.
